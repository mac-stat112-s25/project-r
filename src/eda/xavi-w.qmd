Research Question: What is the effect of state on post graduate success?
1. How does state relate to salary growth?
2. How is salary potential related to the percentage of graduates who make the world a better place?
3. How does state relate to the amount of stem graduates?

These questions should help answer the question of whether certain states have a relationship with higher post graduate success. Success is measured in two ways, economic: salary potential, and social: personal fulfillment.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
library(DataExplorer)
library(ggplot2)
salary_potential <- read.csv("salary_potential.csv")
introduce(salary_potential)
plot_intro(salary_potential)
plot_bar(salary_potential)
```
