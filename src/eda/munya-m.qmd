## Research Question:
How do early and mid-career pay levels vary across U.S. states, and what roles do STEM enrollment and alumni perception (making the world better) play in this variation?

## Why this is important?
Career Planning for Students:
students can make informed decisions about which schools or states offer better long-term financial prospects Especially relevant for students deciding between STEM and non-STEM paths.

Education Policy and Funding:
It highlights states or institutions that produce high-earning graduates, which could inform public investment or scholarship programs.

STEM and Social Impact Balance:
It examines whether higher STEM enrollment aligns with better salary outcomes â€” and whether that comes at the expense of perceived social impact; promoting discussion on balancing career success with societal contributions.

Economic Mobility and Equality:
Understanding salary outcomes across states helps assess regional disparities in economic opportunity.It may inform state-level efforts to improve education outcomes and workforce development.
