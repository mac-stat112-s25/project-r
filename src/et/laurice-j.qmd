What Makes a Strong Team

*Dependence on Each Other*
Team members know they need each other to succeed.
They value both personal and team goals.
Because of this, they don’t waste time competing against each other—instead, they work together.

*Trust*
Team members trust each other and feel safe sharing their thoughts.
This open environment makes it easier to ask questions, speak up, disagree respectfully, and come up with better solutions together.

*Ownership*
Everyone takes pride in the team’s work.
Because they care about the team’s success, they stay committed and put in the effort.

*Using Individual Strengths*
Each team member brings something unique.
Great teams let people use their skills and knowledge to help reach team goals and support the organization.

*Open Communication*
Team members communicate clearly and make sure they understand each other.
This builds trust and avoids confusion.

*Constant Learning*
Strong teams encourage learning and growth.
Members are supported when they try new things, even if they make mistakes—they see it as part of the learning process.

*Team Decision-Making*
Everyone’s input is valued in decision-making.
While the leader may make the final call if needed, the team works together to find the best solutions.

*Resolving Conflict Well*
Good teams handle conflicts quickly and in a healthy way.
People are open and honest, which helps solve issues without drama.
